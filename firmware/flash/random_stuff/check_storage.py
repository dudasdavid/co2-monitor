SD card recovery logic:
1) Unmount: os.umount("/sd")
2) Turn off power: sd.power(False)
3) Turn on power: sd.power(True)
4) Mount it again: os.mount(sd, "/sd")

Issue: if SD card removed (or put back later) and not unmounted filesystem still looks like working,
os.listdir("/sd") returns the folder.
Although looking into subfolders doesn't work and also reading/writing files.

We need a logic to roboustly check that SD card is present and it really works.

os.statvfs('/sd') also gives true-like results when SD is already removed
sd.info() too
sd.present() might be useful
